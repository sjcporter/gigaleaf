Contributing to the gigaleaf codebase
=====================================

In general, the goal is to minimize effort for both Gigantum and outside
developers while doing all necessary due diligence to ensure a legally sound
open source project.

As with Docker and the Linux kernel, Gigantum uses the [Developer Certificate
of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/). This is lightweight approach
that doesn't require submission and review of a separate contributor agreement.
Code is signed directly by the developer using facilities built into git.

## Signing your commits

When you contribute to any Gigantum-managed repository (currently, any
repository under the `gigantum` organization on GitHub), you must certify you
agree with the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/). 
You indicate your agreement by signing your git commits like this:

    Signed-off-by: Pat Smith <pat.smith@email.com>
    
To create a signature, you configure your username and email address in Git.
You can set these globally or locally on just your fork of a Gigantum
repository. You must sign with your real name.  

You can sign your git commit automatically with `git commit -s`. Gigantum does not accept anonymous
contributions or contributions through pseudonyms. 

For a more complete set of instructions that includes the above approach to
code-signing, please see the excellent [instructions on using git to submit
code to the moby repository](https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/docs/contributing/set-up-git.md).
